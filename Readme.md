# TECHNOLOGICA

Technologica is a mod for Minecraft which is currently under development.  As such, at this time the development team makes no guarantee of functionality. 

# CONTENT

The major content groups of Technologica can be broken down into the following categories:

* Agriculture
  * Botany
    * 37 new crops including 2 tall crops and 2 water crops
    * New fertilizer item provides radius of growth on use 
  * Dendrology
    * 25 new trees including 14 fruit trees and 2 sap-bearing trees
    * Fruit trees have leaves which age over time, bearing fruit at the final stage of maturity.  Right-clicking mature fruit tree leaves will drop the fruit and reset the age.
    * Sap-bearing trees have logs which age over time.  Placing a tree tap on the side of a sap-bearing log will gradually decrease the age to zero and drop sap.
      * NOTE: SAP COLLECTION MECHANIC IN WORK.     
    * Stripping logs now drops Mulch, which can be used on Dirt/Grass blocks to create a Mulch block.  This block decays over time, providing radius of growth effect to ageable trees.   
  * Zoology

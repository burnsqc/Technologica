# TECHNOLOGICA

Technologica is a mod for Minecraft which is currently under development.  As such, at this time the development team makes no guarantee of functionality. 

# CONTENT

The major content groups of Technologica can be broken down into the following categories:

* Agriculture
  * Botany
      * 37 new crops including 2 tall crops and 2 water crops.
      * New fertilizer item provides radius of growth on use.
  * Dendrology
    * 25 new trees including 14 fruit trees and 2 sap trees which can be found scattered in existing vanilla biomes or in new Technologica biomes.
    * Fruit trees have leaves which age over time, bearing fruit at the final stage of maturity.  Right-clicking mature fruit tree leaves will drop the fruit and reset the age.
    * Sap trees have logs which age over time.  Placing a tree tap on the side of a sap log will gradually decrease the age to zero and drop sap.
      * NOTE: SAP COLLECTION MECHANIC IN WORK     
    * Stripping logs now drops Mulch, which can be used on Dirt/Grass blocks to create a Mulch block.  This block decays over time, providing a radius of growth effect to ageable trees.
    * New trees have fully integrated wood products, from planks to boats.  
  * Zoology
    * 38 new "real" animals which can be found scattered in existing vanilla biomes or in new Technologica biomes.
* Minerals
  * 15 new minerals including 9 ores and 4 crystals.
    * NOTE: ADDITIONAL MINERALS TO BE ADDED AND ORE SPAWNING MECHANICS IN WORK
  * New minerals can be processed to create new chunks and ingots representing a complete periodic table of elemenents.
    * NOTE: ORE PROCESSING MECHANICS IN WORK 
* Fluids
  * 21 new fluids includings 11 gasses.
    * NOTE: GAS MECHANICS IN WORK 
* Machinery
  * Kinetic
    * New kinetic machinery can be used to speed up, automate, increase yield, and process otherwise un-processable materials.
    * Kinetic machinery requires kinetic power, comprised of Torque and RPM.  
      * Torque determines whether or not a machine is receiving enough kinetic power and how many machines can be run in parallel on the same kinetic power distribution system.
      * RPM determines how quickly a machine completes a process.
    * Kinetic power is distributed via a Line Shaft Pulley system.  
      * Use Line Shaft Hangers to support Line Shafts, and use Pulleys connected via Pulley Belts to transfer kinetic power between Line Shafts.
      * Pulleys come in 3 sizes which can be connected to increase RPM while decreasing Torque or vice versa.  Connecting matched sizes does not change RPM or Torque.
      * NOTE: THE LINE SHAFT PULLEY SYSTEM CONTAINS MANY INTRICATE DETAILS WHICH ARE NOT DESCRIBED HERE.  SEVERAL MECHANICS ARE IN WORK.
    * Kinetic power is generated by a variety of kinetic generators.

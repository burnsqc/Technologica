# CONTENT

The major content groups of Technologica can be broken down into the following categories:

* Agriculture
  * Botany
      * 37 new crops including 2 tall crops and 2 water crops
      * New fertilizer item provides radius of growth on use 
  * Dendrology
    * 25 new trees including 14 fruit trees and 2 sap trees which can be found scattered in existing vanilla biomes or in new Technologica biomes
    * Fruit trees have leaves which age over time, bearing fruit at the final stage of maturity.  Right-clicking mature fruit tree leaves will drop the fruit and reset the age
    * Sap trees have logs which age over time.  Placing a tree tap on the side of a sap log will gradually decrease the age to zero and drop sap
      * NOTE: SAP COLLECTION MECHANIC IN WORK     
    * Stripping logs now drops Mulch, which can be used on Dirt/Grass blocks to create a Mulch block.  This block decays over time, providing a radius of growth effect to ageable trees.
    * New trees have fully integrated wood products, from planks to boats.  
  * Zoology
    * 38 new "real" animals which can be found scattered in existing vanilla biomes or in new Technologica biomes
* Minerals
  * 15 new minerals including 9 ores and 4 crystals
    * NOTE: ADDITIONAL MINERALS TO BE ADDED AND ORE SPAWNING MECHANICS IN WORK
  * New minerals can be processed to create new chunks and ingots representing a complete periodic table of elemenents
    * NOTE: ORE PROCESSING MECHANICS IN WORK 
* Fluids
  * 21 new fluids includings 11 gasses
    * NOTE: GAS MECHANICS IN WORK
